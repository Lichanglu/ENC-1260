NAME
       encode - encode video, audio and/or speech files

SYNOPSIS
       encode [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       This demo uses the Codec Engine to encode data from peripheral device
       drivers to files. Video and speech files are supported. The files
       created will be encoded elementary streams of video or speech.

       You must supply at least one file for the demo to run.

       This demo needs a 720P @ 60Hz or 50Hz video source connected to
       component in.

       The DSP Link and CMEM kernel modules need to be inserted for this demo
       to run. Use the script 'loadmodules.sh' to make sure both kernel modules
       are loaded with adequate parameters.

OPTIONS
       -v <video file>, --videofile <video file>
             Encodes video data to the given file. The file will be created if
             it doesn't exist, and truncated if it does exist. The demo
             detects which type of video file is supplied using the file
             extension. Only H.264 BP (.264 extension) is supported.

       -s <speech file>, --speechfile <speech file>
             Encodes speech data to the given file. The file will be created
             if it doesn't exist, and truncated if it does exist. The demo
             detects which type of speech file is supplied using the file
             extension. The only supported speech algorithm as of now is
             G.711 (.g711 extension).

       -r <resolution>, --resolution <resolution>
             The resolution of video to encode in the format 'width'x'height'.
             Default is the resolution of the input video standard detected.

             Note that the preview will still display the full frame even if
             this option is used.

       -b <bit rate>, --videobitrate <bit rate>
             This option sets the bit rate with which the video will be
             encoded. Use a negative value for variable bit rate. Default is
             variable bit rate.

       -p <bit rate>, --soundbitrate <bit rate>
             This option sets the bit rate with which the audio will be
             encoded. Default is 128000.

       -u <sample rate>, --samplerate <sample rate>
             This option sets the sample rate with which the audio will be
             sampled and encoded (ignored for speech). Default is 44100 Hz.

       -l, --linein
             This option makes the input device for sound recording be the
             'line in' as opposed to the 'mic in' default.

       -k, --keyboard
             Enables the keyboard input mode which lets the user input
             commands using the keyboard in addition to the IR remote control
             interface. At the prompt type 'help' for a list of available
             commands.

       -t <seconds>, --time <seconds>
             The number of seconds to run the demo. Defaults to infinite time.

       -o, --osd
             Enables the On Screen Display for data visualization. If this
             option is not passed, the data will be output to stdout instead.

             If you don't pass a video file, the -o flag will be ignored.

       -h, --help
             This will print the usage of the demo.

EXAMPLE USAGE
       First execute this script to load kernel modules required:
             ./loadmodules.sh

       General usage:
             ./encode -h

       H.264 video encode only in CIF NTSC resolution:
             ./encode -v test.264 -r 352x240

       H.264 video encode at 1Mbps with keyboard interface:
             ./encode -v test.264 -b 1000000 -k

       H.264 video encode and G.711 speech encode:
             ./encode -v test.264 -s test.g711

       AAC audio encode 44100 Hz and 128kbps:
             ./encode -a test.aac -u 44100 -p 128000
